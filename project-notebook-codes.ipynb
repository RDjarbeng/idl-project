{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true}},"source":["# Readme for the Code\n","The provided code is a deep learning pipeline for training a model using the SeResNet architecture on a dataset of face images. The pipeline includes data loading, model creation, training, validation, and testing. Here's a breakdown of the major components and processes in the code:\n","\n","#### Libraries\n","The code begins by installing and importing necessary libraries such as PyTorch, torchvision, wandb, and other relevant packages.\n","\n","#### Data Loading and Preprocessing\n","The code then sets up the data directories, defines transformations for the training and validation datasets, and creates data loaders for the training, validation, and test sets.\n","\n","#### Visualization\n","A visualization section is included to display a few images from the dataset as a sanity check for data augmentation.\n","\n","#### Network Architecture\n","The SeResNetNetwork class is defined, which creates an instance of the SeResNet model using the timm library. The model is then moved to the GPU if available, and the total number of parameters is calculated.\n","\n","#### Training\n","The training process is defined, including the train function for training the model, and the validate function for evaluating the model on the validation set. The code also includes the use of mixed precision training and a learning rate scheduler.\n","\n","#### Wandb Integration\n","The code integrates with Weights & Biases (wandb) for experiment tracking and visualization of training and validation metrics.\n","\n","#### Testing\n","The testing process is defined, including the test function for evaluating the model on the test set and calculating the test accuracy.\n","\n","#### Results\n","The code concludes by printing the test accuracy achieved by the trained model.\n","\n","Overall, the code provides a comprehensive deep learning pipeline for training and evaluating a SeResNet model on a face image dataset.\n","\n","The code is well-structured and includes detailed comments to explain each section and its purpose. It also integrates with wandb for experiment tracking and visualization of training and validation metrics.\n","\n","The provided code demonstrates best practices for deep learning model training, including data loading, model creation, training, validation, testing, and experiment tracking using wandb."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e0d54fa7-da4e-442b-a929-afb55a4c8773","_uuid":"9a24d0a0-9f0b-49cf-b26f-2c615da48968","trusted":true},"source":["#
